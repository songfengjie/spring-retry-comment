/**
 * Exception that indicates that a cache limit was exceeded. This is often a sign of badly
 * or inconsistently implemented hashCode, equals in failed items. Items can then fail
 * repeatedly and appear different to the cache, so they get added over and over again
 * until a limit is reached and this exception is thrown. Consult the documentation of the
 * {@link RetryContextCache} in use to determine how to increase the limit if appropriate.
